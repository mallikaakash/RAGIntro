There are endless use cases for data-backed LLM applications but they can be roughly grouped into four categories:

Structured Data Extraction Pydantic extractors allow you to specify a precise data structure to extract from your data and use LLMs to fill in the missing pieces in a type-safe way. This is useful for extracting structured data from unstructured sources like PDFs, websites, and more, and is key to automating workflows.

Query Engines: A query engine is an end-to-end flow that allows you to ask questions over your data. It takes in a natural language query, and returns a response, along with reference context retrieved and passed to the LLM.

Chat Engines: A chat engine is an end-to-end flow for having a conversation with your data (multiple back-and-forth instead of a single question-and-answer).

Agents: An agent is an automated decision-maker powered by an LLM that interacts with the world via a set of tools. Agents can take an arbitrary number of steps to complete a given task, dynamically deciding on the best course of action rather than following pre-determined steps. This gives it additional flexibility to tackle more complex tasks.
